Write HTTP server for a service that would make http requests to 3rd-party services.

Work algorithm:
The client sends a task to the service to perform an http request to a 3rd-party services. 
The task is described in json format, the generated task id is returned in response and its execution starts in the background.
The client must have a method that can be used to find out the status of the task.
We'd like to see code close to production with clear variable names and http routes, unit tests, etc.

Request examples to service:
------------------------------------------------
Request: POST /task
{
	"method": "GET",
	"url": "http://google.com",
	"headers": {
	    "Authentication": "Basic bG9naW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=",
	    ....
	}
}
Response: 200 OK
{
	"id": <generated unique id>
}
 
------------------------------------------------
Request: GET task/<taskId>
Response: 200 OK
{
	"id": <unique id>,
	"status": "done/in_process/error/new"
	"httpStatusCode": <HTTP status of 3rd-party service response>,
	"headers": {
		<headers array from 3rd-party service response>
	},
	"length": <content length of 3rd-party service response>
}
